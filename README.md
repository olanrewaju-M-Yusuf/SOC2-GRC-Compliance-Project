## Project Title
**Bridging Compliance Gaps: Preparing a FinTech Startup for SOC 2 Type II Certification**

---

## 1. Background & Problem Statement
A FinTech startup handling sensitive customer financial data sought enterprise clients but lacked a formal GRC structure. Tasked with achieving SOC 2 Type II certification in 6 months, the GRC Analyst led the design and implementation of internal controls, policies, and evidence collection aligned with AICPA Trust Services Criteria.

---

## 2. Objective
- Perform a SOC 2 gap analysis
- Develop missing policies and procedures
- Implement risk treatment plans
- Align evidence collection to auditor expectations
- Enable continuous control monitoring

---

| Stakeholder              | Responsibility                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CEO & CTO                | Executive sponsorship, resource allocation, approval of final policies         |
| Legal & Compliance       | Legal review of policies, regulatory alignment, contract clauses               |
| DevSecOps Team           | Control implementation in infrastructure and CI/CD                             |
| Internal Auditors        | Pre-audit validation, evidence trail review                                    |
| External CPA Auditors    | SOC 2 Type II audit execution and assurance reporting                          |

## 4. Frameworks Used
- **AICPA Trust Services Criteria**: Core compliance framework for SOC 2 [(AICPA, 2022)](https://www.aicpa.org/)
- **NIST CSF**: Risk-based governance and control alignment [(NIST, 2018)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.04162018.pdf)
- **CIS Controls v8**: Prescriptive controls for access, logging, and system hardening [(CIS, 2021)](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/v8)

## 5. Project Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Gap Assessment
Conducted a baseline control analysis using Vanta. Identified 22 critical gaps in access management, logging, and change tracking. Established remediation roadmap.

### Step 2: Policy & Control Development
Drafted and formalized policies (Access Control, Incident Response, Data Classification). Reviewed by Legal and operational stakeholders. Stored in Confluence.

### Step 3: Control Implementation
MFA enforced, protected GitHub branches applied, AWS CloudTrail + GuardDuty enabled. Change control via Jira. Controls aligned with CIS best practices.

### Step 4: Evidence Collection & Testing
Automated evidence collection with Vanta. Developed internal testing schedule. Control testing dashboards created in Power BI.

### Step 5: Internal Training & Pre-Audit
Security awareness workshops held for HR, DevOps, Legal. Simulated audit interviews conducted. Policy refinements made prior to external audit.

## 6. Key Takeaways
- Executive buy-in drives compliance culture
- Automation reduces evidence fatigue
- Mock audits increase audit readiness
- Ownership ensures accountability for every control
- Risk-based prioritization accelerates project delivery
- Framework integration ensures long-term governance

---

## 7. Outcomes
- SOC 2 Type II certified within 6 months
- 92% audit control effectiveness score
- 80% reduction in policy non-conformance
- 100% automated evidence collection for key controls
- Quarterly risk dashboards now presented to board
